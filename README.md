<h1>Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>
<h3>In this project we will be exploring the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether Breast Cancer is Benign (Harmless) or Malignant (Cancerous).</h3>
<h4>The dataset includes various information about breast cancer tumors, as well as classification labels of malignant or benign. The dataset has 569 instances, or data, on 569 tumors and includes information on 30 attributes, or features, such as the radius of the tumor, texture, smoothness, and area.</h4>

<h4>The Classifier used is Naive Bayes with Scikit-learn Module. The Accuracy of our model is 97.36 percent. </h4>
